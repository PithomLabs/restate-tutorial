### Why I'm Betting Big on Restate (and You Should Too)

Hey everyone,

I've been vibe coding with Restate lately, learning my way through distributed systems. You know the drill: prompt engineering, context engineering, and wrestling with Go code until it finally compiles and runs beautifully. It's been a journey and I even created a framework on top of the Restate Go SDK to make it even easier to build resilient backend apps.

It's at https://github.com/pithomlabs/rea (think of it as the **business logic layer** behind your Web services).

Let's be real: distributed systems are hard. The complexity of managing synchronous and asynchronous code, handling failures, and keeping everything consistent is usually a nightmare. But Restate nailed it. It makes writing durable, resilient code feel surprisingly easy. It cuts through the noise and lets you focus on the business logic, not the plumbing. And when things get really tough, the `pithomlabs/rea` framework is there to slash the boilerplate even further.

This isn't just about code, though. It's about survival. In this volatile job market, with AI reshaping everything, [we need to adapt](https://medium.com/@pithomlabs/the-time-to-upskill-is-now-building-resilience-in-the-age-of-ai-5c1b5b7aade4). I want to build a community of learners, builders, and writers who are ready to thrive in this new era.

I also want to minimize the stigma around "vibe coding." It's not just hacking; it's a legitimate way to learn. And when you need to build real apps, it's time for smart prompt engineering and context engineering backed by robust guidance in this tutorial series. This is my contribution to the community, a foundation for us to learn and build together.

**Here's the plan:**
I'm open-sourcing the entire `restate-tutorial` folder. It's yours to learn from, build on, and break.

**Call to Action:**
1.  Fork `github.com/pithomlabs/restate-tutorial`.
2.  Jump into the GitHub Discussions.
3.  Write about your Dev/Ops experience. Send it my way, and I'll publish it on the PithomLabs Medium account.
4.  Profit!

Let's build something resilient together. And most of all, enjoy the ride!
